            <p>India is a land of diversities, &nbsp which is well portrayed in its culture and cuisine. 
                A land where taste changes at every 100 kms. Hence, it has a wide spectrum of food.
                Mirchi Masala is a small                       business that hopes to share and spread the love and 
                appreciation of Indian food with the Ann Arbor community.</p>

            <p> Mirchi Masala first opened in fall of 1990. The name comes from two centric things
                that the Indian food revolves around. Mirchi means spicy. Indian food has a lot of heat
                to it that really stimulates one's senses. Masala means spice which reflects the 
                diversity of lentils, spices, and nuts used in Indian cooking
