                appreciation of Indian food with the Ann Arbor community.</p>

            <p> Mirchi Masala first opened in fall of 1990. The name comes from two centric things
                that the Indian food revolves around. Mirchi means spicy. Indian food has a lot of heat
                to it that really stimulates one's senses. Masala means spice which reflects the 
                diversity of lentils, spices, and nuts used in Indian cooking
